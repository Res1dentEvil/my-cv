## Summary
Hello, stranger!
My name is Ivan and I am a frontend developer, passionate about digital products that help people experience everyday life, not endure it. I graduated from the Kyiv National University of Technologies and Design in 2015. Then started working as a manager / technologist in the agro-industrial complex.
Iâ€™m currently looking to join a new team of creative designers and developers. If you think we might be a good fit for one another, give me a call or send me an email
